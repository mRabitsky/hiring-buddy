# hiring-buddy
Bot that checks Reddit's /r/ForHire subreddit for posts and sends a private DM on Discord whenever something new pops up.

### Libraries
Hiring Buddy uses `Reqwest` to poll the subreddit via Reddit's API, and then uses `Serenity` to send a private message via Discord, so that it pops up on my phone and my computer.
